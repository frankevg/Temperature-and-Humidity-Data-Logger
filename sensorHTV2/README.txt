The main script of the project. It creates an instance of the MainController class with the specified parameters, and then calls the run() method of that instance to start the program.

port, baudrate, host, user, password, database, and sleep_time are all parameters used to initialize the MainController object. port and baudrate specify the serial port and baud rate to use for communicating with the temperature and humidity sensor. host, user, password, and database specify the database connection details. sleep_time is the time in seconds to wait between each reading.

The controller.run() method runs an infinite loop that continuously reads data from the sensor, inserts it into the database, and prints the readings to the console. If there is an error opening the serial port, the program will print an error message and exit. Once the program is terminated, the database and serial port are closed.

Overall, this script serves as the entry point for the program and orchestrates the functionality of the other modules.
